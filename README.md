# SoundSage

## **Overview**  
SoundSage is a music recommendation system built using the Spotify Song Dataset. It employs machine learning techniques to suggest songs based on user preferences, focusing on numerical features such as danceability, acousticness, energy, and tempo. The system uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with two similarity metrics: **Cosine Similarity** and **Euclidean Distance**. The user profile evolves dynamically based on feedback, making recommendations more accurate over time.

## **Features**  
- **Recommendation Algorithm**:  
  - Utilizes KNN with Cosine Similarity and Euclidean Distance metrics.  
  - Aggregates user playlists to build a feature-based user profile.  
- **Dynamic Feedback Integration**:  
  - Users rate recommended songs to refine their profiles.  
- **Comparative Analysis**:  
  - Explores differences in recommendations based on Cosine Similarity vs. Euclidean Distance.  
- **Interactive UI**:  
  - Built using Flask for seamless front-end and back-end integration.

## Requirements

Before using this project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `csv`
  - `typing`

You can install any required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Installation and Set up instructions**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/soundsage.git  
cd soundsage  
```  

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed, then run:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### **3. Set Up the Dataset**  
Download the Spotify Song Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs)
1. **Insert the CSV file**:
   - Place the CSV file from Kaggle in a folder named `Data` located in the root directory of the project.
   - The CSV file **must** be named `tracks_features.csv`.

2. **Work with front end**: 
    - Run the create_static_song.py file to create static_song_store.pkl file. 
    - run python3 app.py from the root directory
    - run npm start from the soundsage/frontend to start the front end view 
    - it might take a while for data to show up. Monitor the backend on your two api calls on terminal for progress update

### **4. Run the Application**  
**User Interactive React Front End:** 
```bash  
python app.py  
```  

On a different terminal, to start the front end api
```bach
cd soundsage-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

**Terminal Version:**
```bash  
python main.py
```

## **Usage**  

1. **Upload a Playlist**: Add a CSV file of your songs or use the default user profile.  
2. **View Recommendations**: The system suggests songs based on similarity to your profile.  
3. **Rate Songs**: Provide feedback (1-5 stars) for recommended songs.  
4. **Refine Profile**: Ratings are used to update your preferences for improved recommendations.

## **Key Components**  

- **Algorithm Implementation**:  
  - Cosine Similarity: Calculates angular closeness between user profile and songs.  
  - Euclidean Distance: Measures straight-line distance for feature comparison.  

- **Backend**:  
  - Flask handles data communication between the UI and recommendation system.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Visualizes differences in recommendations generated by each similarity metric.  

---

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Incorporate feature standard deviations to capture variability in user preferences.  
- Add support for real-time playlist updates via APIs (e.g., Spotify Web API).  
- Explore additional machine learning algorithms for improved accuracy.
